# Ecommerce Transaction Prediction
This project was collaborated on with Polly Lloyd.

### The Goal:
The central aim of this college assignment was to develop a predictive model focused on determining whether users, after scrolling through an e-commerce platform, would make a purchase or not. Understanding user behavior and predicting purchase intent are crucial aspects for optimizing the e-commerce experience and increasing conversion rates. The project sought to leverage machine learning techniques to build a model capable of accurately classifying users into those likely to make a purchase and those who might not.

### The Solution:
To achieve this goal, the team developed several predictive models, incorporating features such as transaction amount, device information, and user behavior. The solution involved extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

The team started by exploring and understanding the dataset, identifying patterns, and handling missing values. Feature engineering played a crucial role in extracting meaningful insights from the available data. Various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistical Regression, were experimented with to identify the most effective approach for predicting transaction outcomes.

The implementation also involved fine-tuning the model parameters to optimize performance and reduce false positives. The open-source nature of the framework allowed for collaboration and adaptation, enabling the team to tailor the solution to specific requirements and datasets.

### The Outcome:
The implementation of the E-commerce Transaction Prediction model yielded significant improvements in transaction prediction The model demonstrated high accuracy in its predictions, contributing to a more personalized and targeted user experience. This, in turn, facilitated strategic decision-making for marketing and product placement, ultimately optimizing the conversion rates on the platform.
